        "# 1. Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Credit scoring is a critical process for financial institutions, enabling them to evaluate the risk associated with lending money to applicants. This process is influenced by various factors, including an applicant's financial history, current financial status, and personal circumstances. Among these personal circumstances, the marital status and the number of children an applicant has are believed to impact their probability of defaulting on a loan. This report aims to analyze the correlation between these personal factors and loan default probabilities, providing insights that could enhance the credit evaluation process.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1.1 Objectives:\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary objective of this report is to examine how an applicant's marital status and the number of children they have affect their likelihood of failing to repay a loan. By analyzing existing data on borrower characteristics and loan repayment outcomes, the report seeks to:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Identify and address missing or inaccurate data that could skew the analysis.\n",
        "2. Assess the impact of marital status and the number of children on loan default risk.\n",
        "3. Provide recommendations for incorporating these insights into the credit scoring process.\n",
        "\n",
        "This analysis will help the bank refine its credit assessment criteria, potentially leading to more informed lending decisions and reduced default rates.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1.2 Stages:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Stage 1: Data Inspection and Preprocessing\n",
        "  * Opening and Reading Dataset: The first step involves opening the '/content/drive/MyDrive/DATASET PROJECT/2. Analyzing the risk of borrower default/credit_scoring_eng.csv' file to read and understand the structure and content of the dataset.\n",
        "  * Pre-processing Tasks:\n",
        "    * Identifying Missing Values: Determine the presence of any missing values in the dataset, which are crucial to address as they can lead to inaccurate analyses.\n",
        "    * Filling Missing Values: Devise and implement a strategy for filling in missing values, considering the nature of the data and the potential impact on the analysis.\n",
        "    * Converting Data Types: Assess and convert any real number data types to integer types to simplify analysis and reduce computational complexity.\n",
        "    * Removing Duplicate Data: Identify and remove any duplicate entries to ensure the uniqueness of the dataset, which is critical for the integrity of the analysis.\n",
        "    * Categorizing Data: Organize data into meaningful categories that will facilitate analysis, especially for assessing the impact of marital status and the number of children on loan default rates.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Stage 2: Analysis\n",
        "  * Correlation Between Children and Loan Default Probability: Analyze the relationship between the number of children a borrower has and their likelihood of defaulting on a loan.\n",
        "  * Impact of Marital Status on Loan Default Probability: Examine how an applicant's marital status may influence their risk of failing to repay a loan.\n",
        "  * Income Level and Loan Default Probability: Assess whether there's a correlation between an applicant's income level and their probability of loan default.\n",
        "  * Loan Purpose and Default Probability: Explore how the purpose for which a loan is taken affects the likelihood of loan default.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Stage 3: Conclusions\n",
        "\n",
        "Summarize the findings from the analysis, highlighting the impact of marital status and the number of children on loan default probabilities. Offer recommendations for the bank on how to integrate these insights into their credit scoring model to make more accurate predictions of loan repayment behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "The report will provide a comprehensive view of how personal factors such as marital status and the number of children correlate with loan repayment risks, ultimately aiding the bank in refining their credit evaluation processes."

The preparation we've done ensures that the insights we gain will be based on reliable data, making our findings both valid and actionable. Moving forward, we're well-positioned to explore the relationships between variables such as marital status, number of children, income level, and loan default rates, among others, to make informed decisions or recommendations."

        "The table presents data on the relationship between the number of children a borrower has and their likelihood of defaulting on a loan, including a calculated \"percentage of debt\" for each category of children number. This percentage reflects the proportion of borrowers who have defaulted within each group. Here's a summary of the findings and their implications:\n",
        "1. No Children (0): Borrowers with no children have a default rate of approximately 4.95%. This group has the highest total number of borrowers, both safe and defaulted, indicating a significant portion of the dataset.\n",
        "2. One Child (1): The default rate drops to about 2.07% for borrowers with one child. Despite having fewer borrowers than the no-children group, the decline in the default rate is notable.\n",
        "3. Two Children (2): Borrowers with two children show a further reduced default rate of 0.95%. This trend continues the pattern where an increased number of children correlates with a lower default rate.\n",
        "4. Three Children (3): The default rate for borrowers with three children is exceptionally low at 0.13%, further supporting the trend observed.\n",
        "5. Four Children (4): This group has a very small number of borrowers, with a default rate of only 0.02%, which could be influenced by the small sample size.\n",
        "6. Five Children (5): There are no data available for defaults in the borrowers with five children, likely due to an extremely small sample size or possibly no defaults occurring within this group.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The data reveals a fascinating trend: as the number of children increases, the likelihood of loan default decreases significantly. This could suggest that borrowers with more dependents may exercise greater financial responsibility or caution, possibly due to the increased financial and personal responsibilities of parenting. Alternatively, this could reflect a bias in lending practices, where individuals with more dependents are scrutinized more rigorously, resulting in a selection of borrowers with higher reliability. However, it's essential to note the significant drop in sample size for categories with more children, which can affect the reliability of the percentages of debt. Further investigation, possibly controlling for other factors such as income, marital status, and employment, would be necessary to draw more definitive conclusions about the underlying causes of this trend."

It includes the number of defaults and safe loans for each marital status category, along with the calculated \"percentage of debt\" representing the proportion of defaults within each group. Here's a summary of the findings and their implications:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Civil Partnership: Borrowers in civil partnerships have a default rate of approximately 1.81%. This group represents a significant portion of the dataset, with a substantial number of borrowers in both safe and defaulted categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Divorced: Borrowers who are divorced show a relatively low default rate of about 0.40%. Despite having fewer borrowers compared to other categories, the percentage of defaults is relatively small.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Married: Married borrowers have the highest default rate at around 4.34%. This category has the highest total number of borrowers, indicating a sizable presence in the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Unmarried: Borrowers who are unmarried exhibit a default rate of approximately 1.28%. This group has a moderate number of borrowers and a moderate default rate compared to other categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Widow / Widower: Borrowers who are widowed have a relatively low default rate of about 0.29%. This category has the fewest borrowers but also one of the lowest default rates.\n",

        "**Conclusion:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The data suggests that marital status does indeed have an impact on loan default probability. Married individuals have the highest likelihood of defaulting on loans, followed by those in civil partnerships and unmarried individuals. Divorced and widowed individuals, on the other hand, have relatively lower default rates.\n",
        "\n",
        "Possible explanations for these findings could include differences in financial stability, commitment to financial obligations, or stress levels associated with different marital statuses. For example, married couples may have higher financial responsibilities, such as children or joint financial obligations, leading to increased default risk. However, further analysis, possibly considering additional factors such as income, education level, or credit history, would be needed to confirm these hypotheses and understand the underlying mechanisms driving these trends."

It includes the number of defaults and safe loans for each income category, along with the calculated \"percentage of debt\" representing the proportion of defaults within each group. Here's a summary of the findings and their implications:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Above Average Income: Borrowers with above-average incomes have a default rate of approximately 3.43%. This group has a relatively high number of borrowers and a moderately high default rate.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Average Income: Borrowers with average incomes exhibit a default rate of about 1.12%. Despite having fewer borrowers compared to other categories, the percentage of defaults is relatively low.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. High Income: Borrowers with high incomes have a default rate of around 2.85%. This category has a substantial number of borrowers and a moderately high default rate.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Small Income: Borrowers with small incomes show a remarkably low default rate of approximately 0.26%. This group has the fewest borrowers but also the lowest default rate.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Very High Income: Borrowers with very high incomes have a relatively low default rate of about 0.43%. This category has a moderate number of borrowers and one of the lowest default rates.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The data suggests that there is indeed a correlation between an applicant's income level and their probability of loan default. Borrowers with higher incomes tend to have lower default rates, while those with lower incomes have higher default rates. This pattern is particularly evident in the \"small income\" category, where the default rate is remarkably low compared to other income levels.\n",
        "\n",
        "Possible explanations for these findings could include differences in financial stability, ability to repay debts, or risk tolerance among borrowers with varying income levels. Borrowers with higher incomes may have greater financial resources to handle unexpected expenses or financial setbacks, reducing their likelihood of default. Conversely, borrowers with lower incomes may be more vulnerable to economic shocks or difficulties meeting their financial obligations, leading to higher default rates.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, further analysis, possibly considering additional factors such as credit history, employment stability, or debt-to-income ratio, would be necessary to confirm these hypotheses and understand the underlying factors driving these trends.\n",

        "The table presents data on the relationship between the purpose for which a loan is taken and the likelihood of loan default. It includes the number of defaults and safe loans for each loan purpose category, along with the calculated \"percentage of debt\" representing the proportion of defaults within each group. Here's a summary of the findings and their implications:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Car Loans: Borrowers who take out loans for purchasing cars have a default rate of approximately 1.87%. This group has a moderate number of borrowers and a moderate default rate.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Education Loans: Borrowers who take out loans for educational purposes exhibit a default rate of about 1.73%. Despite having fewer borrowers compared to other categories, the percentage of defaults is relatively low.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Real Estate Loans: Borrowers who take out loans for real estate purposes, such as purchasing a home or property, have the highest default rate at around 3.65%. This category has the highest total number of borrowers, indicating a significant presence in the dataset.\n",

        "4. Wedding Loans: Borrowers who take out loans for weddings show a relatively low default rate of approximately 0.86%. This category has a moderate number of borrowers and one of the lowest default rates.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusion:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The data suggests that the purpose for which a loan is taken does indeed affect the likelihood of loan default. Borrowers who take out loans for real estate purposes, such as buying a house or property, have the highest default rates. This could be attributed to the significant financial commitment and potential risks associated with real estate transactions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Conversely, borrowers who take out loans for weddings have the lowest default rates. This could be because wedding loans are often smaller in amount and may be associated with celebratory events rather than long-term financial commitments.\n",

        "# Stage 3: Conclusions\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, the analysis has shed light on several key factors influencing loan default probabilities:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Number of Children: There exists a notable inverse correlation between the number of children a borrower has and their likelihood of defaulting on a loan. Borrowers with more children tend to have lower default rates, suggesting a possible link to increased financial responsibility associated with parenting. However, the significant drop in sample size for categories with more children should be noted, which may affect the reliability of these findings. Further investigation, while controlling for other factors such as income and marital status, would be beneficial to confirm this trend.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Marital Status: Marital status also plays a significant role in loan default probability, with married individuals exhibiting the highest likelihood of defaulting on loans, followed by those in civil partnerships and unmarried individuals. Possible explanations include differences in financial stability and commitment to financial obligations among different marital statuses. Additional analysis considering factors like income, education level, and credit history would help elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving these trends.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Income Level: The analysis indicates a clear correlation between income level and loan default probability, with borrowers having higher incomes generally exhibiting lower default rates. Borrowers with lower incomes are more vulnerable to economic shocks, leading to higher default rates. However, further analysis considering factors such as credit history, employment stability, and debt-to-income ratio would provide a more comprehensive understanding of these relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Loan Purpose: The purpose for which a loan is taken also impacts loan default probability, with borrowers taking out loans for real estate purposes having the highest default rates. Conversely, borrowers taking out loans for weddings have the lowest default rates. This suggests that the nature and magnitude of financial commitments associated with different loan purposes influence default probabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "Recommendations for the bank to integrate these insights into their credit scoring model include:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Incorporating variables such as number of children, marital status, income level, and loan purpose into the credit evaluation process to make more accurate predictions of loan repayment behavior.\n",
        "* Conducting further analysis to refine and validate the observed trends, considering additional factors and controlling for potential confounding variables.\n",
        "* Developing tailored risk assessment models that account for the unique characteristics and financial circumstances of borrowers based on factors like family composition, marital status, and income level.\n",
        "* Implementing proactive measures to mitigate default risks for vulnerable borrower segments, such as providing financial education and counseling services, offering flexible repayment options, and targeted outreach programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "By leveraging these insights and recommendations, the bank can enhance its credit evaluation processes, minimize default risks, and make more informed lending decisions, ultimately contributing to improved financial stability and customer satisfaction."
